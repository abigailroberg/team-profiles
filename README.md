## Tests
There are 4 test suites - Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern. In each test suite, the creation of the object, the retrival of the object, and methods to get the individual properties of the object are tested. Employee is the umbrella class, while Manager, Intern, and Engineer each have an additional property that differentiates them from one another.
